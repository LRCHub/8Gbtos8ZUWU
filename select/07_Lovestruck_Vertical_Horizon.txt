Here we are under stars
And their light is falling down like carols
Crack the skies you and I
Til the night just opens up and lets go

Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me lovestruck
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me
Don't leave me love

Dim the sound underground
In mute calico and golden sunlight
Feel the break it's all it takes
Got a favorite thing, a favorite way to lie

Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me lovestruck
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me
Don't leave me love
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me lovestruck
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me
Don't leave me love

Lovestruck (you've got me lovestruck now)
Lovestruck (ooh love)
Love
Lovestruck

The trees will guard the sun will guard the ground
Like the breezes blowing from another town
I guarantee the eyes are all darkened now
We lie down we lie down
We go back and forward to evermore
We never needed something that we needed more
The sweet release is all that we believe in now
We lie down we lie down

Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me lovestruck
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me
Don't leave me love
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me lovestruck
Lovestruck lovestruck you leave me
Don't leave me love
