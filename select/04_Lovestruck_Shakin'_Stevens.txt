Down on the boardwalk
Met a little filly
Twinkles in her eyes
Makes me feel a little silly
I make her realize
When she close her eyes at me

Maybe in the morning
Get a little warning
Later in the evening
Get a little squeezin'
I make her realize
When she roll her eyes at me

Well, every time I leave her
Every time I'm with her
I'm headed for a nervous breakdown
Every time I see her
Every time I'm with her
Stand there crippled just like I'm lovestruck

Maybe in the morning
Get a little warning
Later in the evening
Get a little squeezin'
I make her realize
When she roll her eyes at me

Maybe in the morning
Get a little warning
Later in the evening
Get a little squeezin'
I make her realize
When she roll her eyes at me

Well, every time I leave her
Every time I'm with her
I'm headed for a nervous breakdown
Every time I see her
Every time I'm with her
Stand there crippled just like I'm lovestruck

Got a little message
She whispers in my ear
Yeah I keep a little secret
No one else could hear
I make her realize
When she roll her eyes at me

Well, every time I leave her
Every time I'm with her
I'm headed for a nervous breakdown
Every time I see her
Every time I'm with her
Stand there crippled just like I'm lovestruck

Got a little message
She whispers in my ear
Yeah I keep a little secret
No one else could hear

Now I realize
She can roll her eyes at me
Ooh, now I realize
She can roll her eyes at me
Now I realize
She can roll her eyes at me
